# SALES DATA VISUALIZATION 
This repository contains an interactive Power BI Dashboard and dataset used for analyzing the sales performance of a fictional superstore. The analysis helps in understanding trends, customer behavior, product profitability, and geographic distribution of sales.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide business insights through visual analytics using a real-world retail dataset. The Power BI dashboard integrates data from the Superstore.csv file and highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profit, product category performance, customer segmentation, and more.
